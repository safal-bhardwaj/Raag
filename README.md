A open-source music streaming and uploading website. It's functionalities are similar to SoundCloud.

Objective:
This website is created for those artists who don't have a good platform to showcase their music skills. (" hey you mentioned above that it is similar to soundcloud so why don't they have any platform???")
Nice question if it arises in your mind.
But We don't prefer to answer ;)
