        Raag is Created by "Safal Bhardwaj" with a motive to provide a platform to many music artists who don't have much sources to showcase their
        talent and to improve themselves by understanding other's music. </h2>

        <h2 style="font-size:18px;">
        Raag is a platform where you can share your music with other people out there who are willing to listen to some good form of music which was
        hidden under the dust of nepotism and biased media. Here you just have to sign up yourself and upload your music so that people can listen to You
        and if you are here to listen to those outstanding artists who are considered as underrated then you can simply sign up yourself and listen to them.
